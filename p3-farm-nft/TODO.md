1. Rewards thinking - 1 token staked actually, so we need less RATE then with FT tokens
2. Add functions:
	 pay-and-stake with cheddar payments for stake or unstake (done)
Simplification: 
* Rewards every near block (approx 1 second), use multiplication
Docs
* Callbacks for cheddar stake and NFT stake-unstake
